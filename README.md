Triggered Code-Switching Analysis (Marathi–English)

This repo analyzes code-switching behavior in Marathi–English social media text.

The goal is to test whether certain words (called trigger words) increase the likelihood of a language switch in code-mixed tweets.

Using a tagged Marathi–English corpus (MeLID), the project:

Detects code-switch points in tweets

Identifies potential trigger words (proper nouns, numbers)

Runs statistical tests (chi-square)

Trains logistic regression models to measure feature impact

The focus is on practical corpus analysis using Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib) and linguistics
